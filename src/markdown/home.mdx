Itâ€™s tricky to market a game without a budget. Laboring on your passion project in solitude can be difficult. So when you get the opportunity to share your game (players pick up the controller, and start to laugh and smile) it all seems worth it.

Thatâ€™s why Indie Game Con (IGC) exists: to put creator-owned games in front of mainstream audiences, and build a space where game developers can hang out with their own. 

2019 Marks the 6th annual IGC Eugene, OR.  This event is backed by Bitforest, a local non-profit organization sponsored by Innovate Oregon.  IGC is powered by volunteer tech and game dev professionals and its generous community sponsors.  Itâ€™s the ultimate expression of the inclusive game community in the Eugene area.

This event features: Dozens of games developed by local creators, an Artist Alley, vendor booths, workshops, and panels.
